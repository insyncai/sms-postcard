# SMS to Postcard Serverless App

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/996946131494b03f23ee/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mattdini/sms-postcard/maintainability)


With the quaratine/lockdown in place my parents have been really missing seeing their granddaughters.  I built this as a way to send them pictures in the mail with the least amount of resistance.  No apps to download, no software, just send a text message to a twilio number and a postcard will be mailed the next day!

## Requirements

- A Twilio Account (https://www.twilio.com/)
  - With a SMS enabled phone number
- A LOB account (https://lob.com/)
- An AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com/)
